# DIPLAYING-NAME-LED
In the left hand part of the page there will be an 8x8 matrix, with all the Leds off, by clicking them they will turn on and at the bottom of the page there will be the code that represents what you are doing to the matrix, when finished change the "sprite name " and paste the code that you just made, in the code that I made.

To make this project work you will need the library:

FrequencyTimer2
